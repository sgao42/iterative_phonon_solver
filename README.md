# Iterative Phonon Solver
Traditionally, the more-accurate density-functional theory (DFT) can only solve for phonons up to ~100 atoms, while less accurate molecular dynamics or continuum modeling has to be used for larger systems. This is because conventional method require force evaluations on 3N different configurations to build the force-constant matrix. This project aims to use iterative numerical diagonalization techniques to solve for a small number of phonon eigenstates in a large system such as twisted bilayer graphene while keeping DFT-level accuracy. 

The essence of such technique is to start with an initial guess of one vector or a small subspace of vectors, and take a set of iterative steps that only involves matrix multiplication to converge to an eigenstate or eigen-subspace that is close to the initial guess. In the phonon problem, taking the matrix multiplication equates to doing a force evaluation at a perticular configuration. This python code implements such an algothrim by interacting with the DFT code Siesta and doing a new DFT force calculation (to be more precise, a pair of force calculation with the same displacement and opposite sign) on each iteration.
